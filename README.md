This is my first web application project from scratch. I build my own portfolio page for introducing myself to whoever browsing my portfolio, showing my web developing skills and my contact information to look for a job position in the future.

I used some advance CSS skills which I learned from Gorgia Tech BootCamp recently, including: media queries, flexbox, responsive design, CSS variables, Typography, Pseudo-classes,and selectors.

What I've learned:

* The importance of scratch: To draw a wireframing before coding directly can help me make more specific contents for each section in HTML.
* Link the navigation elements to the corresponding section in the same HTML page: use <a href="#id"></a>. 
* Adjust the background image in the center of the page.
* Use "display: flex" and "display: block" to adjust the positions of the elements.
* Connect the email link to outlook: use<a href="mailto: email@example.com></a>
* Create custom CSS variables using :root{}, and apply them to the root of the page, using "var(--)", making them accessible to all other CSS.
* Use :hover{} for styling the cursor, and the elements that the cursor point out through filter changing.
* Presenting a responsive layout that adapts different device screes use @media screen and (condition){}.

## Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)
## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
A GitHub profile with consistently high-quality README files is sure to help you stand out among the crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub, so make sure you give these important files the time and attention they deserve.
