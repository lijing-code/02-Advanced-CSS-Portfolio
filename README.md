# 02-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

## Description

This is my first web application project from scratch. I build my own portfolio page for introducing myself to whoever browsing my portfolio, showing my web developing skills and my contact information to look for a job position in the future.

I used some advance CSS skills which I learned from Gorgia Tech BootCamp recently, including: media queries, flexbox, responsive design, CSS variables, Typography, Pseudo-classes,and selectors.

What I've learned:

* The importance of scratch: To draw a wireframing before coding directly can help me make more specific contents for each section in HTML.
* Link the navigation elements to the corresponding section in the same HTML page: use href="#id". 
* Adjust the background image in the center of the page.
* Use "display: flex" and "display: block" to adjust the positions of the elements.
* Connect the email link to outlook: use<a href="mailto: email@example.com></a>
* Create custom CSS variables using :root{}, and apply them to the root of the page, using "var(--)", making them accessible to all other CSS.
* Use :hover{} for styling the cursor, and the elements that the cursor point out through filter changing.
* Presenting a responsive layout that adapts different device screes use @media screen and (condition){}.
